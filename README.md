# Enhanced-MIPS-ISA

Enhanced MIPS Instruction Set Architecture Project

Description
-----------
Delivering high-quality graphics performance provides current consumer electronics with a 
competitive advantage. To optimize processing performance, modern technology allows for 
parallel processing of vector operations with SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) 
instructions. This project includes a customized Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) 
based upon the MIPS baseline ISA that incorporates SIMD functionality. It includes 12 
AltiVec SIMD instructions as well as application specific enhancements relating 
to computer graphics.

Note
----
The source code was coded and tested in MARS MIPS simulator.
